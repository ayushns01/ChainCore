Project Goal: To build a complete peer-to-peer cryptocurrency blockchain from scratch.

Core Problem It Solves: Current major blockchains (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) use cryptography (ECDSA) that is vulnerable to attacks from future quantum computers. This project aims to create a blockchain that is secure against this threat.

Proposed Solution: To build a new blockchain that uses a quantum-resistant signature algorithm, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, for all transactions instead of the vulnerable classical algorithms.

Key Technical Features:

A decentralized P2P network where nodes can sync with each other.

A Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to secure the ledger.

A wallet system that generates and uses quantum-resistant keys.

A mechanism to create new coins as a reward for miners.

An API and a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the network.
