  Issue: The blockchain nodes are currently operating in isolation and are not communicating with each other.

  Consequence: This has resulted in a network split, where each node is mining its own separate version of the blockchain. There are
  currently at least three different chains being mined simultaneously.

  Cause: The nodes were started without being configured to connect to each other as peers.

  Solution: To resolve this, the nodes need to be restarted with the correct peer-to-peer configuration, allowing them to connect,
  sync, and work on a single, unified blockchain.
